# ML-From-Scratch

## About This Repository
`ML-From-Scratch` is dedicated to providing clear and educational implementations of classic machine learning algorithms using Python, without relying on the advanced frameworks. This repository is ideal for those who wish to understand the inner workings of algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers from the ground up.

## Algorithms Included
This repository includes the following machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch:

- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting real-valued outputs.
- **Logistic Regression**: Suitable for binary classification tasks.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions.
- **K-Means Clustering**: A method of vector quantization.
- _(Include other algorithms as applicable)_
